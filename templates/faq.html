                        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">We operate with two pools of addresses for BTC deposits and transfers - mixed and aggregated. In a mixed pool all received and sent transactions are mixed together and there is no way to discover how many people are behind certain addresses and traceability is extremely difficult, which is very good for privacy but bad for risk scoring. In the aggregated pool all transactions we receive from users are collected on a known single address which is also used to send payments, what will clearly show you have interacted with our exchange and it's good for interacting with other major exchanges to avoid any risks of frozen funds.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">If you have selected the <strong>slow</strong> (or "free") fee mode during the order creation, we have sent Bitcoin to you and used the lowest possible mining fee so you don't have to pay it. The confirmation of a such transaction might vary from 12 hours to around a week, depending on the current mempool workload on the Bitcoin network.</p>
                        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">You can speed it up by using your wallet's <strong>CPFP</strong> functionality. Since the unconfirmed transaction we have sent to you is spendable, you can spend it with a higher fee to incentivize confirmation of both transactions, which is the most simple way to get it included into the blockchain.</p>
                        <p class="text-gray-300">We recommend using the <strong>quick</strong> fee mode if you need your transaction confirmed fast, but we will charge you the blockchain mining fee.</p>

Projects that do not have technical capabilities to accomplish the inclusion criteria or simply avoiding doing so should be considered risky. The main purpose of being included to F-Droid is to ensure the compiled binaries are built from the current release source code without any modifications, because any project included to F-Droid is compiled by F-Droid's infrastructure and not by the project's team that can be compromised any time (this concept is called "reproducible builds").</p>
